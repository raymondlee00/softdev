K15 -- Event Propagation Observations
2020-04-01

v1
Predictions:
- The text inside the cells will appear as a popup when you click on one of them
- After a few times clicking it Firefox will ask me if I want the website to stop making more popups

Observations:
- First prediction was correct
- It only took 2 clicks for the checkbox to prevent additional dialogs to appear

Anything else:
- What if I accidentally ticked that checkbox? It's a necessary part of the website. How can I "untick" it?
  (besides deleting all the data in the browser, that is)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v2
Predictions:
- Considering the words "bubble up" I'm inclined to believe that the "childest" child alerts first.
- Alerts wait for one another, the second alert doesn't appear until the first is dismissed.
- So if I click "Yoda", I should get alerted "Yoda", then "Yoda Luke Obi-Wan", then the entire table.

Observations:
- First prediction was correct
- I didn't expect the <td> tags to also be included in the second alert though
- I also thought that the outermost element would be <table>, not <tbody>.

Anything else:
- I didn't even notice that the table was actually index 0 until opening it in the browser
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v3
Predictions:
- According to analysis in the anything else section, the table is triggered first, then the <td>, then the <tr>.
- I actually used stopPropagation() in a previous assignment. It should make it so that once the table alerts,
  it is stopped dead in its tracks. The td and tr don't give out alerts at all.

Observations:
- Indeed went <tbody>, <td>, <tr>
- stopPropagation() did work as expected

Anything else:
- true is the third element for addEventListener
- According to my research on the MDN, this corresponds to the "capture" argument,
  which means it gets triggered before its children does (basically )
-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v4
Predictions:
- e.stopPropagation() should stop any more alerts after the first alert, since it 
stops the event from bubbling up to parent elements.
- With the addition of e.stopPropagation(), the order of event listeners won't 
matter since, bubbling will be stopped after the leaf table nodes fire off an alert.
- Without e.stopPropagation(), the order of event listeners won't matter either 
since, bubbling will start from the deepest level.

Observations:
- e.stopPropagation() works as expected. When commented out, there are 3 alerts.
- With the addition of e.stopPropagation(), the order doesn't matter but not because 
of the addition itself. The clicky functions fire off from the tree top down, not the 
opposite. This is because the event handler is set during the capture phase (because
 of the third "true" argument in addEventListener) instead of bubbling phase.
- Without e.stopPropation(), the order is the same.

Anything else:
- When would it be useful to set event handlers on the capture phase instead of 
the bubbling phase? And vice versa?
