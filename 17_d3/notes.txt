Notes
- The pink color in the background transitions into place every time I refresh (Ctrl+F5)
- Load d3.js by typing in "d3 = require("d3@5")"
- Learning by examples is the fastest
- Lazy loading the array of data is optimal

Questions
- How does D3 render DOM objects?
- Does D3 use a virtual DOM system to detect changes? Especially if the graphics are going to be intensive.
