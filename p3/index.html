                    Imagine that you want to create a mobile app and you want to cater
                    your app to both Android and iOS devices. You would need to develop
                    two separate apps, one for the Google Play Store and one for the iOS
                    App Store. But with Flutter, you would be able to develop under one
                    codebase and still cater to both mobile markets, which saves you a
                    lot of time and effort. So, what is Flutter?

                    Flutter is a software development kit (SDK) made by Google to
                    develop mobile apps. It is a framework written in Dart, a
                    programming language created by Google in 2011. Flutter is a
                    relatively new framework; its stable 1.0 version was released in
                    December 2018. Despite being new, it has a very active community.
                    <span class="highlight"><a href="https://octoverse.github.com/#top-and-trending-projects">In 2018 -
                            2019, Flutter was the third most popular and second
                            fastest growing open source project on GitHub.</a></span>

                    There are so many different options out there to consider when
                    wanting to develop a mobile app. You could write native apps with
                    Java/Kotlin or Swift/Objective-C, native-like apps with React
                    Native, or hybrid apps with Ionic or PhoneGap. So why use Flutter?
                </p>

                    <p><b>written in one codebase</b></p>
                    <p>
                        Since Flutter is a cross-platform framework, its Dart-based
                        codebase would help you build mobile apps for both iOS & Android
                        at once. So with Flutter development, you essentially have a
                        single app that can be used successfully on multiple platforms.

                    <p><b>open-source and free</b></p>
                    <p>
                        There is an active community that contributes to the Flutter
                        source code on its GitHub repository, helping the dev team fix
                        bugs and suggest improvements.

                    <p><b>extremely fast in performance</b></p>
                    <p>
                        Native apps written in Java/Kotlin for Android or
                        Swift/Objective-C for iOS have the best performance on their
                        respective platforms and they also have full access to the phone's
                        instruments (e.g. camera, microphone, etc.). Flutter is a
                        native-like framework that compiles down into code that runs at
                        speeds close to native apps.

                    <p><b>extremely fast to develop for</b></p>
                    <p>
                        There is a process in Flutter development known as hot reload.
                        Imagine you are working on a Flask app and you fill out a long
                        form and you realize it doesn't work for whatever reason. You make
                        a change in your codebase and then you reload the entire app to
                        see the changes. This doesn't have to be the case in Flutter. Once
                        you make changes in your app, you can simply press a button
                        (typically "r") on your keyboard and you get to see the changes
                        within seconds and you also keep any state your app was in (e.g.
                        filled in forms).

                        Flutter comes with pre-made widgets and components for developers
                        to use. These widgets can either be from a Material UI (Android)
                        or Cupertino (iOS) library. However, the developer has flexibility
                        to create their own style of widgets because Flutter is so
                        malleable.

                <div class="h2"><b>Why does Flutter use Dart?</b></div>
                <p>
                    Dart was a relatively obscure language before the advent of Flutter.
                    However, because of Flutter's popularity,
                    <span class="highlight"><a href="https://octoverse.github.com/#top-languages">Dart became the
                            fastest growing language on GitHub during 2018
                            - 2019</a></span>. So why does Flutter use Dart?
                </p>

                    <p><b>an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) language</b></p>
                    <p>
                        Everything in Dart can be made into a class or object. This is
                        important for Flutter because Flutter uses classes and inheritance
                        for all of its widgets.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>an Ahead of Time (AOT) compiled language</b></p>
                    <p>
                        This means that Dart code is compiled into native-like machine
                        code that runs incredibly quickly on iOS or Android devices, as if
                        you were actually programming in Java or Swift.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>a Just in Time (JIT) compiled language</b></p>
                    <p>
                        This means that Dart code can be compiled as it is being executed.
                        This is important for the quick development process with hot
                        reload and hot restart.

                    <p><b>similar to JavaScript</b></p>
                    <p>
                        Dart is in the C family in terms of syntax, and has a lot of
                        crossover with JavaScript and is easy to learn.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>dynamically and statically typed</b></p>
                    <p>
                        Dart is also a good bridge for JavaScript users because it allows
                        for dynamic typing, but is also safer than JavaScript because it
                        also supports static typing.

                <div class="pl-5">
                <p><b>Widgets!</b></p>
                <p>
                    Everything in Flutter is made up of widgets. And it is the basic
                    building block of any flutter app.
                </p>
                <p><b>What is a widget?</b></p>
                <p>
                    A widget is similar to HTML elements, like a div tag or a table tag.
                    It is basically a UI component with its own set of layout rules and
                    properties. An entire flutter app is built by composing these
                    widgets together in a cohesive manner. Once you compose enough of
                    these widgets, you’ll soon get what is called a widget tree.
                </p>
                <p><b>Widget tree</b></p>
                <p>
                    Web pages have a DOM and Flutter has a Widget Tree. The DOM and the
                    Widget Tree are very similar to one another. Widget tree describes how widgets are composed with each other.
