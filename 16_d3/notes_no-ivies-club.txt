Predictions
- Every element in the "chart" div is styled according to the internal stylesheet (e.g. bg-color of steelblue)
- Width of each bar gets longer down the page as specified

Observations
- Nothing unexpected, really

01
Predictions
- Initial load of the page is empty until commented commands are run in dev console
- First sign of things happening on the page is from running the .enter().append("div") command,
  but every bar will be really small and take up the same amount of space

Observations
- Forgot that the default behavior of a div is to take up the whole width of its row
- Otherwise, pretty expected behavior

Others
- The chart variable is just an empty div. What's the point of running .selectAll() on chart?
- Kinda confused as to what the .data() and .enter() functions do
